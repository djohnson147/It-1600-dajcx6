## Why I chose this major
I chose this major because I thought it was intersting, and I thought it would be a great way to make a lot of **money**
I was going to be a history teacher, but they make on average *less* money. 
I love this so far and I am happy i chose it.
I want to persue Cyber Security or Cloud Sales when I graduate.
